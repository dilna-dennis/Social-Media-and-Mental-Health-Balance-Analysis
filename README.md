Social Media and Mental Health Balance – Data Analysis Project explores the relationship between social media usage and mental well-being among students and young adults by analyzing key factors such as daily screen time, platform usage, stress levels, sleep quality, and exercise frequency. Using Tableau, the dataset was processed and visualized through interactive dashboards with multiple chart types and dynamic filters based on age group, gender, stress category, and sleep quality. The analysis reveals that higher screen time is often associated with increased stress and poorer sleep, while regular exercise contributes to better overall well-being. This project demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, data visualization, and insight-driven reporting, while emphasizing the importance of maintaining a healthy balance between social media usage and mental wellness.
